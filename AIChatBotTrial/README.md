#AI ChatBot Trial

A collection of chatbot experiments using different approaches:

- `ChatBotLangModel.py`: Traditional rule-based language model logic
- `CoPilotChatBot.py`: Using GitHub Copilot for chatbot scaffolding
- `chatBotAi2.py`: Variant testing with advanced prompts

These programs are just initial experiments â€” I plan to create improved versions later.
