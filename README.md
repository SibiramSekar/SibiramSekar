## Hi there 👋 My name is Sibiram Sekar

I'm a BTech student specializing in AI. I focus on designing AI that streamlines real-world processes and powers smarter, more capable robotics.

🔭 Currently working with:

Python | Ollama | OpenAI/Gemini APIs
Vector search (KNN, cosine similarity)
Fine-tuning LLMs and building smart query systems
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced LLM internals, robotics frameworks, and efficient model deployment.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on AI systems that optimize real-world processes or enhance robotics capabilities.

🤔 I’m looking for help with robotics integration using AI, especially in real-time systems.

💬 Ask me about vector search, Ollama fine-tuning, ChatGPT/Gemini APIs, or building scrappy prototypes that work.

📫 How to reach me: sibiram.sekar@gmail.com · www.linkedin.com/in/sibiram-sekar-7136a42bb

🧠 I’m actively looking for internships or startup roles where I can contribute meaningfully while learning hands-on — with the long-term goal of founding my own company.
